Description: A GSSAPI interface module for python
 This Python package is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations.
 The goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
 Kerberos.framework, and instead offer a limited set of functions that do what
 is needed for client/server Kerberos authentication based on
 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4559.txt>.
 .
 Much of the C-code here is adapted from Appache's mod_auth_kerb-5.0rc7.
